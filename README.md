## Hi it's Neethu 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I’m a software developer by profession 👩‍💻 who is passionate about everything around the universe 🌏.

I love reading 📖, and I’m constantly learning new things, exploring new technologies 💡, and plan to contribute to open-source projects .

🚀 About Me
- 🌱 I’m currently planning to review core concepts in technology to refresh my knowledge, build and share a stronger foundation
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have once dream of becoming an author and built a blog, but it's not public yet !
